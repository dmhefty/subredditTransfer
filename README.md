# subredditTransfer
Short script for transferring the subscribed subreddits of one account to another

Made this mostly for fun

To use this you have to create an application on both reddit accounts at: "https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/"
It might be possible to create one application and list both accounts as developers but I didn't try that since the first method 
worked immediately. Might go back later and check.

After creating the apps, you should be able to just follow the prompt's instructions and everything will run through fine.
